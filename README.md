# Caesar-Cipher
A simple Python implementation of the Caesar Cipher, a classic encryption technique. This program allows users to encrypt or decrypt messages by shifting letters a specified number of positions in the alphabet.

🔍 Features
1.Supports both encryption and decryption

2.Handles uppercase and lowercase letters

3.Keeps non-alphabetic characters unchanged (e.g., punctuation, spaces)

4.Validates shift input to ensure it’s between 0 and 25

🚀 How It Works

1.The Caesar Cipher shifts each letter in the message by a fixed number of positions:

2.For encryption, letters are shifted forward.

3.For decryption, letters are shifted backward using the same shift value.
